# Sudoku
A simple game for my college homework.
(1)Randomly choose 11 empty grids out of all 81, fill in with number1~9(randomly generated) under the limitation of Sudoku rules.
(If the number of chosen empty grids is too small, the time complexity will be too large.If the number is too big, there might not be a solution.11 is the best number)
(2)Generate a solution with those 11 filled grids.
(3)Use that solution and empty 40 grids to get a proper base-grid
(4)There can be more than 1 solution for our base-grid.
